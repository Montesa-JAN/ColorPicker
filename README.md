# ColorPicker
Program that takes the dominant colors from a picture and converts it into RGB values.

If you want to extract from pictures make sure to change the file path to make it work. This isn't an app so, the results will be in the terminal. Have fun! 

Pictures were taken from: [Khada - Model Viewer for League of Legends](https://modelviewer.lol/)
